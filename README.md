# An Exercise from file operations in Java

This is an example of one from exercises from the course of Java Back-end Developer which I took part in.
This exercise concerns the theme of file operations in Java.
We have initialized a String array with uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z' and exclamation marks.
The task is to find all exclamation marks from an array. Then we have to replace each exclamation mark by a 'null' value.

Environment used to create this program is Intellij IDEA.
